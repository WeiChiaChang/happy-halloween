# filewatcher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/filewatcher.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/filewatcher)

Simple wrapper around `fs.watch` that falls back to `fs.watchFile` when it runs
out of file handles.

This module is used by [node-dev](https://npmjs.org/package/node-dev)
and [instant](https://npmjs.org/package/instant).

### Usage

```js
var filewatcher = require('filewatcher')

// the default options
var opts = {
  debounce: 10,    // debounce events in non-polling mode by 10ms
  interval: 1000,  // if we need to poll, do it every 1000ms
  persistent: true // don't end the process while files are watched
}

var watcher = filewatcher(opts)

// watch a file
watcher.add(file)

watcher.on('change', function(file, stat) {
  console.log('File modified: %s', file)
  if (!stat) console.log('deleted')
})

watcher.on('fallback', function(limit) {
  console.log('Ran out of file handles after watching %s files.', limit)
  console.log('Falling back to polling which uses more CPU.')
  console.log('Run ulimit -n 10000 to increase the limit for open files.')
})

watcher.remove(file)
watcher.removeAll()
```
