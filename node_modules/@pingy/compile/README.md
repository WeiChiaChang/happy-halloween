This is based on the [Tolk](https://github.com/Munter/tolk) library but does less things based on the "small modules that do one thing" philosophy. Specifically, it doesn't inline sourcemaps and doesn't autoprefix CSS. It can also optionally minify assets, which Tolk doesn't support.

Baby Tolk is a "do the right thing" tool for transpiling. It reads a file from the file system, transpiles it (including sourcemaps where supported) with the available transpilers. It can also optionally minify the output.

Returns a promise that resolves with the resulting transpiler output.

Installing the individual transpilers baby tolk should use is up to the consumer. There are no transpiler dependencies out of the box. So if you only need babel and sass, install `babel` and `node-sass`.

Tolk is useful for tools that handle precompiling for you, but might also be used directly in your task runner of preference in order to skip some of the many plugins that do the same but worse.

**Current precompiler support:** `LiveScript`, `babel`, `coco`, `coffee-script`, `dogescript`, `less`, `marked`, `myth`, `node-sass`, `stylus`, `swig`


Usage
-----

```
npm install baby-tolk
```

Out of the box this won't transpile anything (but it can minify html, css and JS). In order to do more, for example babel and sass, also do this:

```
npm install node-sass babel
```

Now you are ready to start reading files from the file system. Baby Tolk automatically loads the transpilers it has access to in the scope it is run in. You can change the scope by setting the `global.babyTolkCompilerModulePath` variable path. By convention Baby Tolk won't compile any files if the filename begins with an underscore `_` character.

```javascript
// you can set `global.babyTolkCompilerModulePath` to a specific node_modules folder if desired
// global.babyTolkCompilerModulePath = '/some/folder/node_modules';
var babyTolk = require('baby-tolk');

babyTolk.loadAdapters();

babyTolk.read('path/to/stylesheet.scss').then(function (compiled) {
  // compiled.result is the transpiled output as a string
  console.log(compiled.result);

  // compiled.sourcemap is the transpiled output as an object
  // You can use JSON.stringify to convert it to a string
  console.log(JSON.stringify(compiled.sourcemap));
}, function (err) {
  // In case anything failed
  throw err;
});
```

Want the output to be minified?

```javascript

babyTolk.read('path/to/stylesheet.scss', {minify: true}).then([success], [fail]);

```

You can also minify vanilla css/js/html files without the transpilation step.

```javascript

babyTolk.read('path/to/app.js', {minify: true}).then([success], [fail]);

```

It's also possible to turn source-maps off.

```javascript

babyTolk.read('path/to/app.js', {sourceMaps: false}).then([success], [fail]);

```
