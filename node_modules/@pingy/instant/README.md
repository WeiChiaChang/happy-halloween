# instant â€“ transparent live-reloading

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/instant.png)](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/instant)

Instant is ultra lightweight live-reload implementation with a unique feature set:


* Works in all browsers including mobile devices and IE6
* No browser plugin required
* Can be used as drop-in replacement for the express.static() middleware
* Production mode with zero overhead
* Automatic client code injection

## How it works

All static files that are served by the middleware are added to a watch list. Whenever one of these files is modified the client gets notified an reloads the resource. CSS files are updated without reloading the whole page.

Instant automatically injects a script-tag right before the closing `body` tag
of any HTML page (including dynamic ones) in order to load the client code.

The client uses
[server-sent events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) to
listen for updates. Browsers that don't support EventSource will fall back to a
[hidden iframe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29#Hidden_iframe).


## Usage

```js
var express = require('express');
var instant = require('instant');

var app = express();
app.use(instant(__dirname + '/static'));
```

If `$NODE_ENV` is set to `production` or `{ bypass: true }` is passed as option, instant will behave just like `express.static()` with no additional overhead.

### Reloading dynamic files

The instant middlware also exposes a `.reload()` function that can be called to
reload arbitrary URLs. This can be useful if you want to reload scripts or
stylesheets that have been processed/compiled on the fly.

Note: If you don't want to server any static files at all you can safely omit
the  `root` argument.

```js
var express = require('express');
var instant = require('instant');

var app = express();
var ins = instant();

app.use(ins);

app.get('/tick', function(req, res) {
  res.send('Current date: ' + new Date());
});

// Trigger a reload of the page every 10 seconds:
setInterval(function() {
  ins.reload('/tick');
}, 10000);
```

### Options

The following options are supported:

* __bypass__ If set to `true` instant will behave just like express.static(). Defaults to `process.env.NODE_ENV == 'production'`
* __watch__ List of file extensions to watch. Defaults to `['html', 'js', 'css']`
* __prefix__ A prefix to add to the URLs under which the client script and the EventSource are exposed. Defaults to `'/instant'`
* __delay__ Amount of time in milliseconds to wait before triggering a reload. Defaults to `10`

All other options like `etag`, `dotfiles`, `index`, etc. are passed on to [send](https://www.npmjs.com/package/send).

## instant(1)

There is also an `instant` binary that can be used to spawn a development
server in the current directory.
The [instant-server](https://github.com/fgnass/instant-server) is packaged as
speparate module and can be installed via npm:

```
npm install -g instant-server
```
