## Caveat 
At this stage, you have to use Google Chrome (version >  60 at least) for browsing happy-halloween since Web Speech API still an [experimental technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) and other browsers still under implementation so far. You can check [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-recognition) for more details.

## Usage
Choose to <b>Allow</b> the site's use of your microphone :

  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WeiChiaChang/happy-halloween">
    <img alt="open-your-microphone" src="https://i.imgur.com/tfGf5cH.png">
  </a>
</p>

You will see the red light if you allow your microphone :

    <img alt="see-red-light" src="https://i.imgur.com/iE55p9T.png">
  </a>
</p>

That's all, just say "happy halloween" to your browser ! ![turtle](http://i.imgur.com/879dfXS.gif)
